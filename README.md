heightFromDocumentTop
=====================

Onscroll event add/remove class based on distance of element from top of document. Some basic logic around 'getBoundingClientRect()'. Mainly a UI thing.

Example of usage at: http://michaelepierce.com/portfolio.html. Using it to alter grayscale value of <img> once it reaches 100px from top of window.
